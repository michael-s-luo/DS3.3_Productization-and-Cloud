# Module 4 Assignment

This assignment will closely follow lesson - the main importance of the assignment today is to ensure that you understand the steps that took place.

- Deploy your app! Suggested app name `twitoff-yourusername`
- Debug! You'll definitely have to debug some...

If using the Heroku CLI the following commands may be helpful to you.

- `heroku log` is your (command line) friend, as is `heroku run` (see below)
- Logging into the Heroku control panel in your browser can also help
- `heroku config:set variable=value` lets you set environment variables
- `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev` creates a free hosted PostgreSQL database and assigns the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable appropriately ([more info](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql))
- Help your classmates! Deploying is always rough at first, and you'll see and learn new things by helping each other as well
