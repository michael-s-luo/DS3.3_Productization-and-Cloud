# Guided Project Walkthrough

We'll deploy the app! We'll step through all of the following:

- Creating the app on Heroku
- Adding Heroku as a git remote (Heroku deploys using git)
- Making sure we have an appropriate `Procfile` (tells Heroku the process to
  run when starting up our app)
- Setting config vars (the Heroku equivalent of environment variables)

## Turning an existing folder into a git repository

If you didn't start your project out as a Git Repository there's a simple way to do this and get the commands that you need.

Go to GitHub.com, make sure you're logged in and create a new repository with the same name as the folder on your computer. It's not necessary that it be named the same as the folder on your computer, but I find that it makes things less confusing.

When you create the repository if you don't select any of the pre-defined options (besides making the repository public) you'll be presented with a list of commands that you can use to initialize your repository as a git repo and to push it to github for the first time. This list of commands includes setting GitHub as a "remote" for the repository which is the most important step. Setting the "remote" is what creates the connection between your local folder and the repository on GitHub.

### Make sure you don't push your `.env` file

Navigate to the project folder that you want to add to github from the command line and add check to see if you have a `.gitignore` file and make sure that file includes your `.env` file. You DO NOT want to push your `.env` file to GitHub on accident.

See if your repository has a `.gitignore` file

`ls -a`

If it doesn't create one and make sure to add `.env` as its own row in the `.gitignore`

After you've done this, you'rw ready to use the Git commands shown on the screen after you've created this new repository to push your repository up to Git. You can even just copy them all as one chunk and paste them into your command line tool.

I was going to put a copy of the commands here, but I won't because the commands will be customized to your repository, so it's best to get them from GitHub directly.

## Pushing an existing repo to GitHub

If your app has already been created as a git repository or if you've made additional changes to your files since connecting it with GitHub, go ahead and make sure that the latest changs have been pushed to GitHub. From the command line run:

Tells us if any files or folders have been modified since we last pushed changes to GitHub

`git status`

Adds any new or changed files to the "git staging" (get's it ready to be committed.)

`git add .`

I like to run git status again just to see the colors of my files change, this lets me know that indeed everything has been added to staging. This command is not necessary and literally does nothing, but somehow it's comforting to me to see the colors change to know that I haven't missed something.

`git status`

Saves the current snapshot of our directory and packages it up as a "commit" that is ready to be pushed to GitHub. We'll always include a commit message along with our commit, that's what the `-m` flag stands for is "message." Inside of the parentheses leave a short note to future-you that summarizes the changes that you're making to the repository files with this commit.

`git commit -m "your commit message here"`

Send the changes across the wire to GitHub. If you have an old repository you might need to say `master` instead of `main`.

`git push origin main`

And that's it. You should now be able to see all of the updated files on GitHub!

## Making a new app on Heroku

If you haven't already. Sign up for an account at [Heroku.com](https://heroku.com). Once you have an account, make a new app (not a pipeline!). Give this app a unique name for your project.

Once you have created the new app, select the "Connect to GitHub" Deployment Method. Once you do this you'll be prompted to connect Heroku to your GitHub account. Go ahead and follow the instructions as indicated to give heroku permissions to access your account. Then we'll search for the specific repository that we want to link to this Heroku App. Once you've linked the repository to the Heroku app, this will allow Heroku to grab all of the files in the GitHub repository and use them when launching the app. This has the benefit of making it very easy to update your app on Heroku. You simply need to push your changes to GitHub and then come to Heroku and tell it to redeploy. It's a pretty slick system!

Once you've connected your app to GitHub. Scroll down to the "Manual Deploy" section and to deploy the `main` branch. Hit the `Deploy Branch` button. This will start up some deployment logs where you'll see Heroku installing the dependencies listed in your pipfile. When it's done it should give you a URL for your deployed app!

Go ahead and try and navigate to your deployed app once the build has completed. You may find that you get a screen saying you have an application error. That's ok! We'll work to debug what might be going on.

## Debugging a H14 application error

To view the error logs for your app. Come back to Heroku and in the top right corner of the screen, click the `More` buttton. You will be shown a dropdown menu where the first option is "view logs" go ahead and click on that.

![View Heroku Application Logs](/images/view-logs.png)

You might see a couple of telling messages in these logs.

1) You might see some messages about Twitter authentication failing. Hmmm... Why might that be?

2) If you navigate to your application or refresh the page on the Application Error screen you'll see a new message show up in the logs that says something like:

`at=error code=H10 desc="App crashed" method=GET path="/" host=twitoff-ds32.herokuapp.com`

The error code `H10` is important H stands for Heroku and means that this is a Heroku-specific error code. If you google what H10 errors are you'll see a lot of people talking about Procfiles.

What's a Procfile?

`Procfile` is short for "Process File" and it's a file that we can include in our app that will tell Heroku how to start our app. Heroku might not know to call `flask run` to start the app.

From the command line, create a `Procfile` in the root of your `twitoff-DS##` project folder.

Next, we'll install a more Heroku-friendly way of starting up our Flask web server. We'llinstall a tool called `gunicorn` and we'll tell Heroku in the `Procfile` how to use gunicorn to start up our app.

`pipenv install gunicorn`

After gunicorn has finished installing, open your Procfile and add this line:

`web: gunicorn twitoff:APP -t 120`

This tells Heroku to use `gunicorn` to start up our heroku ap and tells it where it can find the APP variable. We'll also give this a timeont of 120 seconds. because we're working on the free tier Heroku Dyno our app may take a little while to startup. We don't want it to stop trying to startup simply because the Heroku instance isn't very powerful, so this timeout is extra generous to allow plenty of time for Heroku to try and launch the app before erring out with a "gateway timeout" message.

Once you've installed `gunicorn` and added a `Procfile` with this line of code in it, be sure to push your changes back to GitHub and then go ahead and try to redeploy the app.

## Debugging a H10 application error

When you redeploy the app, you may see new errors in the Heroku Logs, this time you'll see a `H10` error. One thing that can trigger this error message is missing environment variables. Remember that we used our `.gitignore` to make sure that our `.env` file would never be pushed to GitHub? Well Heroku can't see the `.env` file so it doesn't have our Twitter API keys and it doesn't know where to find the database within our app.

Go ahead and add your `TWITTER_API_KEY`, `TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET` and `DATABSE_URI` environment variables to Heroku. Heroku calls these "Config Vars" and you can add them under the "Settings tab within Heroku.

![Heroku Config Vars](/images/config-vars.png)

After you've added those config vars go ahead and redeploy your app.

## Creating the Database

Once you've deployed your app, navigate to its Heroku URL. If all has gone according to plan, you will see a different screen. If you see a screen that says `Internal Server Error`. That means that the app has at least launched! Now we're getting an error within our flask application. 

![Internal Server Error](/images/internal-server-error.png)

We'll always get this error the very first time we deploy our app because our database hasn't been created yet. Go ahead and navigate to the `/reset` route on your app and that should generate the sqlite3 database and your app should be working after that. (It will also work for any other users who come to it).

And that's it! You're app should now be up and running on Heroku!
