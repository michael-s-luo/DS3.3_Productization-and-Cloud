This assignment will closely follow lesson - the main importance of the assignment today is to ensure that you understand the steps that took place.

- Reproduce the lecture tasks (logistic regression fitting, predicting,
  returning) in a REPL/notebook, with different (real) data you select and pull
- Continue incorporating the predictive code in the application - you should be
  able to write fairly pure functions, and then invoke them from Flask routes
- Add a form to let the client select two Twitter Users and enter Tweet text to
  predict which user is more likely to tweet the given text
- Add a form to let the client request new Twitter Users be added and after submission adds their
  Tweets to the database making them available for our predictive model.
