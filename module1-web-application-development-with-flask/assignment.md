# Unit 3 Sprint 3 Module 1 Assignment

This assignment will closely follow  today's guided project - the main importance of the assignment today is to ensure that you understand the steps that took place during the Guided Project.

- Reproduce the steps from lecture: write and run a basic local Flask web
  application
- Create a model for `Tweet` and `User` as demonstrated in lecture, and populate
  your local (SQLite) database with some invented data (at least 6 Tweets and 2
  Users)
- For tomorrow, make sure to sign up for the [Twitter Developer
  API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) and check out the
  [SpaCy documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101), as we will use the Twitter API and to populate our database with real data from Twitter, and we'll use the SpaCy Python package to build a simple NLP prediction model.
